# NYC Accessbility 

The NYC Accessibility project encompasses two sets of tools:

* Mine social media for accessibility information: Investigate scraping sites like Yelp, Foursquare, and Twitter for details about accessibility at specific locations and generating automatic readings for a site like [AXS Map](http://www.axsmap.com/)

* MTA Accessibility: Scrape the output of the MTA regarding the availability and maintentance status of elevators, escalators, and other affordances for those with mobility impairments. Present it in a more usable format. (Start with [NYC Subways and Buses EE Outage System](http://advisory.mtanyct.info/EEoutage/).)
