# NYC Accessbility 

The NYC Accessibility project encompasses two sets of tools:

* Mine social media for accessibility information: Investigate scraping sites like Yelp, Foursquare, and Twitter for details about accessibility at specific locations and generating automatic readings for a site like [AXS Map](http://www.axsmap.com/)

* MTA Accessibility: Scrape the output of the MTA regarding the availability and maintentance status of elevators, escalators, and other affordances for those with mobility impairments. Present it in a more usable format. (Start with [NYC Subways and Buses EE Outage System](http://advisory.mtanyct.info/EEoutage/).)

## Background

Some of the initial motivation for this project came from these news pieces:

* [New York City has a great subway if you're not in a wheelchair](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/new-york-has-a-great-subway-if-youre-not-in-a-wheelchair.html) (NY Times)
* [This man's epic quest for a rainbow bagel makes a crucial point about accessibility](http://mashable.com/2017/03/23/rainbow-bagel-quest-cerebral-palsy-zach-anner/#AbVvvgdNqPqA) (Mashable)
* [#CripTax: Hidden costs of being disabled](https://storify.com/SFdirewolf/criptax-hidden-costs-of-being-disabled) (Storify)

The initial work for these projects was done at the first NYC D4D hackathon.
